#### CodeQL (WIP)
Descover vulnerabilities across a codebase with CodeQL.
#### Purpose of Using CodeQL
- **Automated Vulnerability Detection**: CodeQL helps identify security flaws like buffer overflows, injection attacks, and other potential issues automatically.
- **Custom Query Capabilities**: Developers can write and share custom queries to detect specific patterns in the codebase, enabling targeted analysis.
- **Code Quality Improvement**: Beyond security, CodeQL assists in identifying code smells and anti-patterns that degrade code quality.
- **CI/CD Integration**: CodeQL integrates into CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous monitoring of code for vulnerabilities, preventing issues before they make it to production.
- **Cross-Language Support**: It supports multiple languages, making it useful across diverse projects within the team.
